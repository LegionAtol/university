# Image Classification with CNNs

As part of the "Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learning" course, we built and trained various convolutional neural networks to classify images.

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow (with Keras API)** - used to design, train, and evaluate the CNNs
- **OpenCV** - 
- **scikit-learn** - used for data splitting, preprocessing (e.g., LabelEncoder), and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- **pandas** - used to manage datasets and handle tabular data.
- **matplotlib, seaborn** - used to visualize model performance, confusion matrices and others.
- **Google Colab** - for training on GPU

## Models used
- Custom CNNs
- GoogleNet
- MobileNetV2

## Teamwork
- Team of 2/3 people
