# Image Classification with CNNs

As part of the "Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learning" course, we built and trained various convolutional neural networks to classify images.

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow (with Keras API)** - used to design, train, and evaluate the CNNs
- **OpenCV** - 
- **scikit-learn** -
- **pandas** - used to manage datasets
- **matplotlib, seaborn** - 
- **Google Colab** - for training on GPU

## Models used
- Custom CNNs
- GoogleNet
- MobileNetV2
