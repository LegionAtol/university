# Time Series Forecasting
This project was developed as part of the "Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learning" course at Politecnico di Milano.
We explored various recurrent and convolutional neural network architectures to model and forecast sequential time series data.

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow (with Keras)** - used to design, train, and evaluate models (MAE - Mean Absolute Error, MSE - Mean Squared Error)
- **scikit-learn** - for train/test splitting
- **pandas** - used to manage datasets and handle tabular data
- **matplotlib, seaborn** - used to visualize model performance and compare the predictions with the reference values

## Models used
- LSTMs
- Bidirectional LSTMs
- Bidirectional LSTMs + Convolutional layers (CNN)
- ResNet-like architecture for time series

## Teamwork
- Team of 2 people
